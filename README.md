Unified Governance Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Framework implemented in [MeTTa language for cognitive computations](https://metta-lang.dev/).

Basis: a first-order logical framework for Natural Language Semantics massively grounded on the notion of reification. 

Reification is the action of conceptualising abstract entities as things of the world. 

In formal logic, this amounts at formalising abstract entities as first-order individuals, i.e., constants or variables of the logic. 

The framework is massively grounded on the notion of reification, meaning that any abstract entity can be reified into a first-order individual; then, new assertions can be made on these individuals and the fact that one of these assertions holdÑ‹ for one of these individuals can be recursively reified again into a new first-order individual.

The Framework is powered by massive reification, abstract eventuality and instantiations handling, ISO 24617-4:2014 role set, Hobbs' logic, Deontic Traditional Sceheme, 3 reasoning levels, and explicit representation of judgements.
